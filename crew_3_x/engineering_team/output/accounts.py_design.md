# Design for Trading Simulation Platform

## Module: account_management_system

This module defines a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform.

### Class: Account

#### Description:
A class representing a user's account, managing funds, and transactions related to trading activities.

#### Methods:

- **__init__(self, user_id: str, initial_deposit: float)**
  - Initializes an account with a unique user ID and an initial deposit of funds.
  - Initializes an empty portfolio and transaction history.
  - Stores the initial deposit for profit and loss calculations.

- **deposit_funds(self, amount: float) -> None**
  - Deposits a specified amount of funds into the account balance.

- **withdraw_funds(self, amount: float) -> bool**
  - Withdraws a specified amount from the account balance.
  - Prevents withdrawal if it would result in a negative balance.
  - Returns `True` if withdrawal is successful, otherwise `False`.

- **buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool**
  - Buys a specific quantity of shares for a given symbol.
  - Checks the current share price using `get_share_price(symbol)`.
  - Prevents purchase if the cost exceeds the available balance.
  - Updates the portfolio with the purchased shares.
  - Records the transaction in the transaction history.
  - Returns `True` if purchase is successful, otherwise `False`.

- **sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool**
  - Sells a specific quantity of shares for a given symbol.
  - Checks if the user has enough shares to sell.
  - Prevents selling shares not owned by the user.
  - Updates the portfolio after selling.
  - Records the transaction in the transaction history.
  - Returns `True` if sale is successful, otherwise `False`.

- **calculate_portfolio_value(self) -> float**
  - Calculates the total value of the current portfolio by summing up the value of all shares.
  - Uses `get_share_price(symbol)` to determine the current price for each share in the portfolio.

- **calculate_profit_loss(self) -> float**
  - Calculates the profit or loss by comparing the current total portfolio value to the initial deposit.

- **get_holdings(self) -> dict**
  - Returns a dictionary representing the current holdings of shares in the user's portfolio.

- **get_transaction_history(self) -> list**
  - Returns a list of all transactions (including deposits, withdrawals, purchases, and sales) made by the user.

- **get_account_balance(self) -> float**
  - Returns the current balance of the account i.e. cash not invested.

### Functions:

#### Function: get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float
- Description: Returns the current price for a given share symbol. For testing, returns fixed prices for AAPL, TSLA, and GOOGL.

### Usage:

1. Initialize the account with a user ID and initial deposit.
2. Use `deposit_funds` and `withdraw_funds` to manage account balance.
3. Use `buy_shares` and `sell_shares` for trading activities.
4. Access `calculate_portfolio_value` and `calculate_profit_loss` for financial insights.
5. Retrieve portfolio and transaction information with `get_holdings`, `get_transaction_history`, and `get_account_balance`.
